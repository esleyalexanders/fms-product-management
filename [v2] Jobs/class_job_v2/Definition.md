## 🤝 Group vs. One-to-One

The terms **Group** and **One-to-One** define the student-to-tutor/teacher ratio, which is critical in service delivery.

### 3. Group

* **Definition:** A **Group** refers to *multiple students* (usually 2 or more) learning the same content simultaneously with one instructor. The exact size (e.g., small group, large group) can vary by center policy.
* **Key Characteristics:**
    * **Ratio:** High student-to-tutor ratio (e.g., 3:1, 5:1, or more).
    * **Benefit:** Lower cost per student; fosters collaborative learning.
    * **Drawback:** Less personalized attention for each student.

### 4. Group Session

* **Definition:** A **Group Session** is a single instructional meeting where *multiple students* are taught together by one instructor, focusing on a common subject or topic.
* **Distinction:** A Group Session can be part of a formal **Class** (e.g., a session of the "SAT Math Class") or a stand-alone, scheduled meeting for students who need help in a specific area (e.g., "Thursday's Group Session on essay writing").

### 5. One-to-One Job (or One-to-One Tutoring)

* **Definition:** A **One-to-One Job** (often shortened to **1:1**) is a tutoring arrangement where *one tutor works exclusively with one student* during a session.
