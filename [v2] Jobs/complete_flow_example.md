## Key Takeaways

### Why Split into 2 Jobs?

1. **Different Services** = Different job types (cleaning vs mowing)
2. **Different Staff** = Separate accountability (cleaner vs gardener)
3. **Different Schedules** = Flexibility (Nov 5 vs Nov 6)
4. **Independent Completion** = Better tracking (one can finish before other)
5. **Flexible Invoicing** = Customer can pay separately if needed
6. **Better Reporting** = See cleaning revenue vs mowing revenue separately

### Status Flow Rules

1. **Quote Status** stays "Approved" throughout job execution
2. **Quote closes** only when ALL jobs are paid
3. **Each Job** has independent lifecycle (Scheduled ‚Üí Paid)
4. **Change Orders** only affect the specific job they're linked to
5. **Invoices** generated per job (2 invoices in this case)
6. **Manual activities** (üñêÔ∏è) happen outside system but get recorded

### Assignment Options

| Scenario | Assignment Type | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Simple service, 1 person | Individual Staff | Sarah (cleaner) |
| Large job, multiple people | Team (Pre-defined) | Cleaning Team A (3 members) |
| Custom team selection | Team (Custom) | Select Sarah + Mike + Lisa |
| Same time, different services | 2 Individual Staff | Sarah (cleaning) + Mike (mowing) |
| Same time, same service | Team | 3 cleaners working together |

### Payment Scenarios

| Scenario | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Separate Payments** | Customer pays Invoice 1 ($110), then Invoice 2 ($231) |
| **Combined Payment** | Customer pays total ($341) at once, manager allocates to both jobs |
| **Partial Payment** | Customer pays Invoice 1, delays Invoice 2 ‚Üí Job 2 goes Overdue |
| **Late Payment** | Invoice overdue ‚Üí System alerts manager ‚Üí Customer pays late |

---

## System Automation Points

### Automatic Actions

1. **Invoice Generation**: When job approved ‚Üí auto-generate invoice
2. **Quote Closure**: When all jobs paid ‚Üí auto-close quote as "Won"

4. **Status Updates**: When staff marks complete ‚Üí auto-update job status
5. **Notifications**: When job created ‚Üí auto-notify assigned staff

2. **Change Order Request**: Staff calls manager for extra work
3. **Change Order Approval**: Manager asks customer, customer approves
4. **Payment**: Customer transfers money to bank
5. **Payment Recording**: Manager records payment in system
6. **Quality Check**: Manager reviews photos and approves completion
