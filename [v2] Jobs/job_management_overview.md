# Job Management System Overview

## System Created

I've implemented a complete job management system based on industry best practices. Here's what has been created:

## Files Created

### 1. `job_list.html` (Job Listing Screen)
**Location:** `[v2] Jobs/job_list.html`

**Features:**
- Job listing with table view
- Stats cards: Total Jobs, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed
- Filters: Search, Status, Team, Date Range, Sort
- Job status badges with color coding:
  - üìÖ Scheduled (Blue)
  - ‚öôÔ∏è In Progress (Yellow)
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è On Hold (Orange)
  - ‚úì Completed (Green)
  - üí∞ Invoiced (Purple)
  - ‚úï Cancelled (Red)
- Priority badges: High, Medium, Low
- View and Edit actions for each job
- Pagination support

### 2. `job_detail.html` (Job Details Screen)
**Location:** `[v2] Jobs/job_detail.html`

**Features:**
- Complete job information display
- Customer details section
- Team assignment information
- Line items table with pricing
- Timeline & activity tracking
- Quick actions sidebar:
  - Add Note
  - Take Photo
  - View Quote
  - Generate Invoice
- Back to Jobs button
- Edit Job button
- Complete Job button

### 3. Updated `quote_list.html`
**Changes:**
- "View Job" button for converted quotes (purple button with clipboard icon)
- Navigates to job detail page when quote is converted to job
- Proper routing: `../Jobs/job_detail.html?id=${jobId}`

## Job Status Workflow

```
Quote Approved ‚Üí Convert to Job ‚Üí Scheduled ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Invoiced ‚Üí Paid
```

**Status Definitions:**
1. **Scheduled** - Job is booked and ready to start
2. **In Progress** - Work has begun on the job
3. **On Hold** - Job temporarily paused
4. **Completed** - All work finished
5. **Invoiced** - Invoice sent to customer
6. **Cancelled** - Job not completed

## Sample Job Data Structure

```javascript
{
    id: 'J-2024-001',
    quoteId: 'Q-2024-001',
    customerId: 1,
    customerName: 'Sarah Johnson',
    customerEmail: 'sarah.j@email.com',
    customerPhone: '0412 345 678',
    location: '123 Main St, Melbourne VIC 3000',
    scheduleDate: '2024-10-28',
    scheduleTime: '10:00 AM',
    assignedTeam: 'Team 1 - Primary',
    assignedMembers: ['John Smith', 'Jane Doe'],
    status: 'scheduled',
    priority: 'high',
    total: 412.50,

    lineItems: [...]
}
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Filtering & Search
- Search by customer name, email, job ID, location
- Filter by status, team, date range
- Sort by date, customer, priority

### Statistics

## Navigation Flow

```
Quote List (converted quotes) ‚Üí View Job ‚Üí Job Detail
Job List ‚Üí View Job ‚Üí Job Detail

```

## Next Steps (Optional)

To complete the job management system, you may want to add:

1. **job_edit.html** - Job editing screen
2. **job_create.html** - Manual job creation (without quote)
3. **Calendar View** - Visual scheduling interface
4. **Time Tracking** - Track actual vs planned hours
5. **Materials Tracking** - Inventory usage
6. **Invoicing** - Generate invoices from completed jobs
7. **Mobile App** - Field team access

## How to Use

### Accessing Job Details from Quote
1. Go to Quotes Management
2. Filter by "Archived (Converted)" or find a converted quote
3. Click the purple "View Job" button
4. Job detail page opens

### Accessing Job List
1. Navigate to `[v2] Jobs/job_list.html`
2. View all jobs with filtering and search
3. Click "View" or "Edit" to manage jobs

## Design Consistency

The job management screens follow the same design patterns as:
- Quote list (`quote_list.html`)
- Quote create/edit screens
- Customer management screens
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Responsive design

All screens maintain visual consistency with the FMS system.
